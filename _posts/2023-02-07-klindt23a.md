title: Topological ensemble detection with differentiable yoking
abstract: Modern neural recordings comprise thousands of neurons recorded at millisecond
  precision. An important step in analyzing these recordings is to identify <em>neural
  ensembles</em> â€” subsets of neurons that represent a subsystem of specific functionality
  A famous example in the mammalian brain is that of the grid cells, which separate
  into ensembles of different spatial resolution. Recent work demonstrated that recordings
  from individual ensembles exhibit the topological signature of a torus. This is
  obscured, however, in combined recordings from multiple ensembles. Inspired by this
  observation, we introduce a topological ensemble detection algorithm that is capable
  of unsupervised identification of neural ensembles based on their topological signatures.
  This identification is achieved by optimizing a loss function that captures the
  assumed topological signature of the ensemble and opens up exciting possibilities,
  e.g., searching for cell ensembles in prefrontal cortex, which may represent cognitive
  maps on more conceptual spaces than grid cells.
