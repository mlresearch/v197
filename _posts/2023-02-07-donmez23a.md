title: On the ambiguity in classification
abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for geometric deep learning that incorporates
  ambiguous data in learning tasks. This framework uncovers deep connections between
  noncommutative geometry and learning tasks. Namely, it turns out that learning tasks
  naturally arise from groupoids, and vice versa. We also find that learning tasks
  are closely linked to the geometry of its groupoid $*$-algebras. This point of view
  allows us to answer the question of what actually constitutes a classification problem
  and link unsupervised learning tasks to random walks on the second groupoid cohomology
  of its groupoid.
