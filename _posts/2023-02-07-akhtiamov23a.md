title: Connectedness of loss landscapes via the lens of Morse theory
abstract: Mode connectivity is a recently discovered property of neural networks stating
  that two weight configurations of small loss can usually be connected by a path
  of small loss. The mode connectivity property is interesting practically as it has
  applications to design of optimizers with better generalization properties and various
  other applied topics as well as theoretically as it suggests that loss landscapes
  of deep networks have very nice properties even though they are known to be highly
  non-convex. The goal of this work is to study connectedness of loss landscapes via
  the lens of Morse theory. A brief introduction to Morse theory is provided.
