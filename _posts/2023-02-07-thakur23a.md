title: Does Geometric Structure in Convolutional Filter Space Provide Filter Redundancy
  Information?
abstract: 'This paper aims to study the geometrical structure present in a CNN filter
  space for investigating redundancy or importance of an individual filter. In particular,
  this paper analyses the convolutional layer filter space using simplical geometry
  to establish a relation between filter relevance and their location on the simplex.
  Convex combination of extremal points of a simplex can span the entire volume of
  the simplex. As a result, these points are inherently the most relevant components.
  Based on this principle, we hypothesise a notion that filters lying near these extremal
  points of a simplex modelling the filter space are least redundant filters and vice-versa.
  We validate this positional relevance hypothesis by successfully employing it for
  data-independent filter ranking and artificial filter fabrication in trained convolutional
  neural networks. The empirical analysis on different CNN architectures such as ResNet-50
  and VGG-16 provide strong evidence in favour of the postulated positional relevance
  hypothesis. '
