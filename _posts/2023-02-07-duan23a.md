title: 'See and Copy: Generation of complex compositional movements from modular and
  geometric RNN representations'
abstract: 'A hallmark of biological intelligence and control is combinatorial generalization:
  animals are able to learn various things, then piece them together in new combinations
  to produce appropriate outputs for new tasks. Inspired by the ability of primates
  to readily imitate seen movement sequences, we present a model of motor control
  using a realistic model of arm dynamics, tasked with imitating a guide that makes
  arbitrary two-segment drawings. We hypothesize that modular organization is one
  of the keys to such flexible and generalizable control. We construct a modular control
  model consisting of separate encoding and motor RNNs and a scheduler, which we train
  end-to-end on the task. We show that the modular structure allows the model to generalize
  not only to unseen two-segment trajectories, but to new drawings consisting of many
  more segments than it was trained on, and also allows for rapid adaptation to perturbations.
  Finally, our model recapitulates experimental observations of the preparatory and
  execution-related processes unfolding during motor control, providing a normative
  explanation for functional segregation of preparatory and execution-related activity
  within the motor cortex.'
