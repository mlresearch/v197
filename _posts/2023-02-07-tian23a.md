title: Mixed-membership community detection via line graph curvature
abstract: Community detection is a classical method for understanding the structure
  of relational data. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying mixed-membership
  community structure. We argue that it is beneficial to perform this task on the
  line graph, which can be constructed from an input graph by encoding the relationship
  between its edges. Here, we propose a curvature-based algorithm for mixed-membership
  community detection on the line graph. Our algorithm implements a discrete Ricci
  curvature flow under which the edge weights of a graph evolve to reveal its community
  structure. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in a series of benchmark
  experiments.
