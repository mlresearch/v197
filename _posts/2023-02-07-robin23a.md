title: Periodic signal recovery with regularized sine neural networks
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a periodic one-dimensional signal with
  neural networks, and designing models that are able to extrapolate the signal well
  beyond the training window. First, we show that multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU
  activations are provably unable to perform this task, and lead to poor performance
  in practice even close to the training window. Then, we propose a novel architecture
  using sine activation functions along with a well-chosen non-convex regularization,
  that is able to extrapolate the signal with low error well beyond the training window.
  Our architecture is several orders of magnitude better than its competitors for
  distant extrapolation (beyond 100 periods of the signal), while being able to accurately
  recover the frequency spectrum of the signal in a multi-tone setting.
