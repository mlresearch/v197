title: Computing representations for Lie algebraic networks
abstract: Recent work has constructed neural networks that are equivariant to continuous
  symmetry groups such as 2D and 3D rotations. This is accomplished using explicit
  {\it Lie group representations} to derive the equivariant kernels and nonlinearities.
  We present three contributions motivated by frontier applications of equivariance
  beyond rotations and translations. First, we relax the requirement for explicit
  Lie group representations with a novel algorithm that finds representations of arbitrary
  Lie groups given only the {\it structure constants} of the associated Lie algebra.
  Second, we provide a self-contained method and software for building Lie group-equivariant
  neural networks using these representations. Third, we contribute a novel benchmark
  dataset for classifying objects from relativistic point clouds, and apply our methods
  to construct the first object-tracking model equivariant to the Poincar√© group.
