title: Disentangling images with Lie group transformations and sparse coding
abstract: Discrete spatial patterns and their continuous transformations are two important
  regularities in natural signals. Lie groups and representation theory are mathematical
  tools used in previous works to model continuous image transformations. On the other
  hand, sparse coding is an essential tool for learning dictionaries of discrete natural
  signal patterns. This paper combines these ideas in a Bayesian generative model
  that learns to disentangle spatial patterns and their continuous transformations
  in a completely unsupervised manner. Images are modeled as a sparse superposition
  of shape components followed by a transformation parameterized by $n$ continuous
  variables. The shape components and transformations are not predefined but are instead
  adapted to learn the dataâ€™s symmetries. The constraint is that the transformations
  form a representation of an $n$-dimensional torus. Training the model on a dataset
  consisting of controlled geometric transformations of specific MNIST digits shows
  that it can recover these transformations along with the digits. Training on the
  full MNIST dataset shows that it can learn the basic digit shapes and the natural
  transformations such as shearing and stretching contained in this data. This work
  provides the simplest known Bayesian mathematical model for building unsupervised
  factorized representations. The  source code is publicly available under MIT License.
