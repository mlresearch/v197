title: Geometry of inter-areal interactions in mouse visual cortex
abstract: The response of a set of neurons in an area is the result of the sensory
  input, the interaction of the neurons within the area as well as the long range
  interactions between areas. We aimed to study the relation between interactions
  among multiple areas, and if they are fixed or dynamic. The structural connectivity
  provides a substrate for these interactions, but anatomical connectivity is not
  known in sufficient detail and it only gives us a static picture. Using the Allen
  Brain Observatory Visual Coding Neuropixels dataset, which includes simultaneous
  recordings of spiking activity from up to 6 hierarchically organized mouse cortical
  visual areas, we estimate the functional connectivity between neurons using a linear
  model of responses to flashed static grating stimuli. We characterize functional
  connectivity between populations via interaction subspaces. We find that distinct
  subspaces of a source area mediate interactions with distinct target areas, supporting
  the notion that cortical areas use distinct channels to communicate. Most importantly,
  using a piecewise linear model for activity within each trial, we find that these
  interactions evolve dynamically over tens of milliseconds following a stimulus presentation.
  Inter-areal subspaces become more aligned with the intra-areal subspaces during
  epochs in which a feedforward wave of activity propagates through visual cortical
  areas. When the short-term dynamics are averaged over, we find that the interaction
  subspaces are stable over multiple stimulus blocks. These findings have important
  implications for understanding how information flows through biological neural networks
  composed of interconnected modules, each of which may have a distinct functional
  specialization.
