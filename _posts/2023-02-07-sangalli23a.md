title: 'Moving frame net: SE(3)-equivariant network for volumes'
abstract: Equivariance of neural networks to transformations helps to improve their
  performance and reduce generalization error in computer vision tasks, as they apply
  to datasets presenting symmetries (e.g. scalings, rotations, translations). The
  method of moving frames is classical for deriving operators invariant to the action
  of a Lie group in a manifold.Recently, a rotation and translation equivariant neural
  network for image data was proposed based on the moving frames approach. In this
  paper we significantly improve that approach by reducing the computation of moving
  frames to only one, at the input stage, instead of repeated computations at each
  layer. The equivariance of the resulting architecture is proved theoretically and
  we build a rotation and translation equivariant neural network to process volumes,
  i.e. signals on the 3D space. Our trained model overperforms the benchmarks in the
  medical volume classification of most of the tested datasets from MedMNIST3D.
