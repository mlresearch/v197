title: Sparse Convolutions on Lie Groups
abstract: Convolutional neural networks have proven very successful for a wide range
  of modelling tasks. Convolutional layers embed equivariance to discrete translations
  into the architectural structure of neural networks. Extensions have generalised
  continuous Lie groups beyond translation, such as rotation, scale or more complex
  symmetries. Other works have allowed for relaxed equivariance constraints to better
  model data that does not fully respect symmetries while still leveraging on useful
  inductive biases that equivariances provide. How continuous convolutional filters
  on Lie groups can best be parameterised remains an open question. To parameterise
  sufficiently flexible continuous filters, small MLP hypernetworks are often used
  in practice. Although this works, it typically introduces many additional model
  parameters. To be more parameter-efficient, we propose an alternative approach and
  define continuous filters with a small finite set of basis functions through anchor
  points. Regular convolutional layers appear as a special case, allowing for practical
  conversion between regular filters and our basis function filter formulation, at
  equal memory complexity. The basis function filters enable efficient construction
  of neural network architectures with equivariance or relaxed equivariance, outperforming
  baselines on vision classification tasks.
