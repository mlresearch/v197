title: Do neural networks trained with topological features learn different internal
  representations?
abstract: There is a growing body of work that leverages features extracted via topological
  data analysis to train machine learning models. While this field, sometimes known
  as topological machine learning (TML), has seen some notable successes, an understanding
  of how the process of learning from topological features differs from the process
  of learning from raw data is still limited. In this work, we begin to address one
  component of this larger issue by asking whether a model trained with topological
  features learns internal representations of data that are fundamentally different
  than those learned by a model trained with the original raw data. To quantify “different”,
  we exploit two popular metrics that can be used to measure the similarity of the
  hidden representations of data within neural networks, neural stitching and centered
  kernel alignment. From these we draw a range of conclusions about how training with
  topological features does and does not change the representations that a model learns.
  Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that structurally, the hidden representations of
  models trained and evaluated on topological features differ substantially compared
  to those trained and evaluated on the corresponding raw data. On the other hand,
  our experiments show that in some cases, these representations can be reconciled
  (at least to the degree required to solve the corresponding task) using a simple
  affine transformation. We conjecture that this means that neural networks trained
  on raw data may extract some limited topological features in the process of making
  predictions.
