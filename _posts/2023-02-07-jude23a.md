title: Capturing cross-session neural population variability through self-supervised
  identification of consistent neuron ensembles
abstract: Decoding stimuli or behaviour from recorded neural activity is a common
  approach to interrogate brain function in research, and an essential part of brain-computer
  and brain-machine interfaces. Reliable decoding even from small neural populations
  is possible because high dimensional neural population activity typically occupies
  low dimensional manifolds that are discoverable with suitable latent variable models.
  Over time however, drifts in activity of individual neurons and instabilities in
  neural recording devices can be substantial, making stable decoding over days and
  weeks impractical. While this drift cannot be predicted on an individual neuron
  level, population level variations over consecutive recording sessions such as differing
  sets of neurons and varying permutations of consistent neurons in recorded data
  may be learnable when the underlying manifold is stable over time. Classification
  of consistent versus unfamiliar neurons across sessions and accounting for deviations
  in the order of consistent recording neurons across sessions of recordings may then
  maintain decoding performance and uncover a task-related neural manifold. Here we
  show that self-supervised training of a deep neural network can be used to compensate
  for this inter-session variability. As a result, a sequential autoencoding model
  can maintain state-of-the-art behaviour decoding performance for completely unseen
  recording sessions several days into the future. Our approach only requires a single
  recording session for training the model, and is a step towards reliable, recalibration-free
  brain computer interfaces.
