title: On the level sets and invariance of neural tuning landscapes
abstract: 'Visual representations can be defined as the activations of neuronal populations
  in response to images. The activation of a neuron as a function over all image space
  has been described as a "tuning landscape". As a function over a high-dimensional
  space, what is the structure of this landscape? In this study, we characterize tuning
  landscapes through the lens of level sets and Morse theory. A recent study measured
  the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps of neurons in different brain regions. Here,
  we developed a statistically reliable signature for these maps based on the change
  of topology in level sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively
  throughout the cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning
  landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can
  be locally regarded as isotropic radial basis functions, but not globally. This
  shows the power of level sets as a conceptual tool to understand neuronal activations
  over image space. '
