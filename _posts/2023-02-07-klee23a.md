title: Image to Icosahedral Projection for SO(3) Object Reasoning from Single-View
  Images
abstract: Reasoning about 3D objects based on 2D images is challenging due to variations
  in appearance caused by viewing the object from different orientations. Tasks such
  as object classification are invariant to 3D rotations and other such as pose estimation
  are equivariant. However, imposing equivariance as a model constraint is typically
  not possible with 2D image input because we do not have an a priori model of how
  the image changes under out-of-plane object rotations. The only SO(3)-equivariant
  models that currently exist require point cloud or voxel input rather than 2D images.
  In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on icosahedral group convolutions
  that reasons in SO(3) by learning a projection of the input image onto an icosahedron.
  The resulting model is approximately equivariant to rotation in SO(3). We apply
  this model to object pose estimation and shape classification tasks and find that
  it outperforms reasonable baselines.
