title: Conformal Isometry of Lie Group Representation in Recurrent Network of Grid
  Cells
abstract: The activity of the grid cell population in the medial entorhinal cortex
  (MEC) of the mammalian brain forms a vector representation of the self-position
  of the animal. Recurrent neural networks have been proposed to explain the properties
  of the grid cells by updating the neural activity vector based on the velocity input
  of the animal. In doing so, the grid cell system effectively performs path integration.
  In this paper, we investigate the algebraic, geometric, and topological properties
  of grid cells using recurrent network models. Algebraically, we study the Lie group
  and Lie algebra of the recurrent transformation as a representation of self-motion.
  Geometrically, we study the conformal isometry of the Lie group representation where
  the local displacement of the activity vector in the neural space is proportional
  to the local displacement of the agent in the 2D physical space. Topologically,
  the compact and connected abelian Lie group representation automatically leads to
  the torus topology commonly assumed and observed in neuroscience. We then focus
  on a simple non-linear recurrent model that underlies the continuous attractor neural
  networks of grid cells. Our numerical experiments show that conformal isometry leads
  to hexagon periodic patterns in the grid cell responses and our model is capable
  of accurate path integration. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/DehongXu/grid-cell-rnn}.
