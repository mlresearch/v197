title: Group invariant machine learning by fundamental domain projections
abstract: We approach the well-studied problem of supervised group invariant and equivariant
  machine learning from the point of view of geometric topology. We propose a novel
  approach using a pre-processing step, which involves projecting the input data into
  a geometric space which parametrises the orbits of the symmetry group. This new
  data can then be the input for an arbitrary machine learning model (neural network,
  random forest, support-vector machine etc). We give an algorithm to compute the
  geometric projection, which is efficient to implement, and we illustrate our approach
  on some example machine learning problems (including the well-studied problem of
  predicting Hodge numbers of CICY matrices), finding an improvement in accuracy versus
  others in the literature.
